Puts the comments and likes from FriendFeed on your posts.  

== Description ==

This plugin will take the comments & 'likes' on your posts from FriendFeed and place them on the post that they're related to.  The comments come with the person's name, a link to their FriendFeed profile & their FriendFeed image.
Your blog's readers can also comment on & like your posts directly from a form displayed under the FriendFeed comments (this is an option that can be turned off)

== Installation ==

1. Download the zip file & extract the contents to /wp-content/plugins
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Update your FriendFeed nickname on the Settings page & set any other settings there
4. Place the tag `wp_ffcomments()` on your template where you want the comments to appear (probably above or below the normal comments section).  The tag needs to be inside 'The Loop' on the index or archive templates, but can be placed anywhere on the single post template.
5. Styling. Out of the box, the plugin defines some default style rules, but these can be turned off in the admin paege & the HTML it generates is easily styled.
