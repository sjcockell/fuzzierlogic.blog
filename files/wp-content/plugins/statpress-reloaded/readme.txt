This plugin shows you real time statistics about your blog. It collects information about visitors, spiders, search keywords, feeds, browsers, OS etc.


== Description ==

This plugin (a highly improved fork of StatPress) shows you real time statistics about your blog. It collects information about visitors, spiders, search keywords, feeds, browsers, OS etc.

Once the plugin StatPress has been activated it immediately starts to collect information.
Using StatPress Reloaded you can see your visitors actions while they are surfing your blog or check which are the preferred pages, posts and categories.
In the Dashboard menu you will find the StatPress Reloaded page where you could look up the statistics (overview or detailed).
StatPress Reloaded also includes a widget you can add to a sidebar (or easy PHP code if you can't use widgets!).

= Multilanguage =
StatPress Reloaded speaks English, Italian, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Norwegian, Dutch, Brazilian, Turkish, Swedish!
Could you translate StatPress in your language? Please contact me!

= DB Table maintenance =

StatPress can automatically delete older records to allow the insertion of newer records when your space is limited.

= StatPress Widget / StatPress_Print function =

The widget is customizable. These are the available variables:

* %thistotalvisits% - this page, total visits
* %since% - Date of the first hit
* %visits% - Today visits
* %totalvisits% - Total visits
* %os% - Operative system
* %browser% - Browser
* %ip% - IP address
* %visitorsonline% - Counts all online visitors
* %usersonline% - Counts logged online visitors
* %toppost% - The most viewed Post
* %topbrowser% - The most used Browser
* %topos% - The most used O.S.
* %thistotalpages% - Total pageviews so far
* %pagestoday% - Pageviews today
* %pagesyesterday% - Pageviews yesterday
* %latesthits%

Now you could add these values everywhere! StatPress offers a new PHP function *StatPress_Print()*.
* i.e. StatPress_Print("%totalvisits% total visits.");
Put it whereever you want the details to be displayed in your template. Remember, as this is PHP, it needs to be surrounded by PHP-Tags!

== Installation ==

Upload "statpress-reloaded" directory in wp-content/plugins/ . Then just activate it on your plugin management page.
That's it, you're done!
(Note: If you have been using the old StatPress before, deactivate it. Your data is taken over!)


= Update =

* Deactivate the plugin
* Delete "statpress-reloaded" directory in wp-content/plugins/
* Upload the content of the ZIP
* Activate "Statpress Reloaded" on your plugin management page
* In the Dashboard click "StatPress", then "StatPressUpdate" and wait until it will add/update db's content

Update from within Wordpress Admin Panel does work, too. But don't forget to run "StatPressUpdate" afterwards!

*Version 1.4.11 (25.10.2008)*

* Sorry, no new features or anything, just some severe security fixes. Next version with some improvements should follow before december - thanks for all your support!

*Version 1.5 (17.12.2008)*

* 2.7 compability update
* If you have http:BL installed, every entry gets checked against the database from http://www.projecthoneypot.org/ - there will be options to auto-delete/ignore entries with certain criteria in the future. For now, you could already manually delete entries with a score higher than x directly via mySQL.
* Updated Spiders and Definitions
* You can now keep custom banned IPs, so they are not overwritten on each update. You need to create "statpress-reloaded-custom" in the plugins directory (it cannot be inside StatPress' own directory as this gets completely removed during an update!) and put your own "banips.dat" in there.
* This also works for the "spiders.dat" file.
* Fixed some problems with the localization
* Added a new meno option called "Unknown Agents" that will show you a list of all entries with a user-agent that is not covered by your local definition files. This makes it easier to look out for new spiders.
* In the overview section, the table of "Last spiders" now also tells you what page the spider was indexing.
* <b>Big thanks for all the help and participation in the support forums! Most of the new features come from users, I just put them together. I'm thrilled to see the development of this plugin!</b>
* This will, if no major problems or security leaks occur, hopefully be the last release of the 1.x-branch so far. StatPress Reloaded 2.x will be a nearly 100% rewrite and still take quite some time to finish. But it will be significantly faster and a lot easier to maintain for me.

*Version 1.5.2 (17.12.2008)*

* I wonder if I'll ever manage to release a bigger update without some remaining errors. Thanks for your quick reports, hopefully this is a stable release now for real.

*Version 1.5.3 (18.12.2008)*

* Small CSS bugfix
* Fixed some missing translation strings, updated POT file. Thanks, SimonBoba!

*Version 1.5.4 (19.12.2008)*

* Translation related fixes

*Version 1.5.5 (24.01.2009)*

* DISTINCT search, thanks to  rsramirez!
* Few smaller bigfixes.

*Version 1.5.7 (31.01.2009)*

* It is just not possible to release a bugfix-version without instantly bugfixing afterwards, I guess.

*Version 1.5.8 (03.02.2009)*

* Tiny GUI fix: "Overview and StatPress aren't doubling each other in the menu any longer.
* Spanish translations update, thanks a lot to nv1962!
* BAN-IPs can now be entered in the same format as Google Analytics uses: regular expressions.  Thanks, mihu!
